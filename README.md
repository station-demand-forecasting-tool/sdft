# Station Demand Forecasting Tool

This is the R package for the Station Demand Forecasting Tool (SDFT).

Note that while this package controls the model, *it is not standalone*. Most of the heavy lifting takes place in a PostgreSQL database that requires setting up with data tables and additional wrapper functions for pgRouting.

It is planned to provide a Docker container for easy implementation of the tool. See:
