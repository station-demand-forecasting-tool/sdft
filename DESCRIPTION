Description: This model is intended to forecast demand for new local railway stations. 
  It has been calibrated on all Category E and F stations in mainland GB and incorporates
  a station choice component where the probability of a station being chosen is estimated at
  the unit postcode level and used to weight the population variable in a trip end model.
